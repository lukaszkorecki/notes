# Emacs as tmux replacement

Before moving back to Emacs I did what many developers do - built an IDE of sorts by
combining Vim, Tmux and Bash. By use of scripting, REPLs and such one can
glue all these tools together to have things like 'open a new shell and send this text to it'
done with a bit of work.

## Brave new world

After refreshing my muscle memory and building [a sane config](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader) I proceeded to simply replace Vim with Emacs.

One of the reasons for switching was that I get write a lot of Lisp - mostly Clojure and some Scheme ([Chicken Scheme](http://call-cc.org/) in particular, but I'm also looking at [Racket](https://racket-lang.org)). Naturaly, [Emacs being a sort of Lisp machine](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LispMachine) the tooling for working with Lisps is fenomenal. Tools like [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) show how Emacs can shine as an IDE, without being a huge mess of a GUI and a resource hog.
Inspired by these tools I started exploring things like [inf-ruby](https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby) and running terminals withing Emacs (via [ansi-term](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm))  more often than opening tmux windows and panes. There was simply no need for that.

The only thing that I used tmux for was persisting the session on the machine to quickly resume what I was working on. That has a major drawback - ssh-agent details get lost when that happens, which means tools like [magit](https://magit.vc/) become less useful and require Emacs restart.

## Removing tmux

 Using [daemon mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon) in Emacs one can replicate all features (and more) of tmux/screen:

 - sessions can be suspended and resumed
 - universal copy and paste between terminal any type of a buffer
 - window/pane layout management
 - tmux 'windows' can be emulated with packages like [eyebrowse](https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse)



 ## `ssh-agent` issue

 With a simple shell script:

 ```bash
 if pgrep -f emacs ; then
  emacs --daemon

fi

emacsclient -nw

 ```

 and [an extra package](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader/commit/17ed38e4fe5e6b6f2140ebf97e5b798118b652a7) I can now use [magit](https://magit.vc/) without any issues. It simply injects relevant SSH environment variables and "magicaly" fixes the problem.


## Issues?

Only issue I keep running into is that a long running (week?) Emacs session sometimes becomes corrupted and syntax higlighting stops to work.
I haven't found a fix for this, but given my experience with Emacs so far the fix surely exists :-)
