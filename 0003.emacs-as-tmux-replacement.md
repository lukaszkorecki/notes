# Emacs as tmux replacement

Before moving back to Emacs I did what many people do - built an IDE of sorts by
combining Vim, Tmux and Bash. By clever use of scripting, REPLs and such one can
glue all these tools together to have things like 'open a new shell and this text to it'
done quite trivialy.

## Brave new world

After refreshing my muscle memory and building [a sane config](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader) I proceeded to simply replace Vim with Emacs.

One of the reasons for switching was that I get write a lot of Lisp - mostly Clojure and some Scheme ([Chicken Scheme](http://call-cc.org/) in particular, but I'm also looking at [Racket](https://racket-lang.org)). Naturaly, [Emacs being a sort of Lisp Machien](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LispMachine) the tooling for working with Lisps is fenomenal. Tools like [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and [Geiser](http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) show how Emacs can shine as an IDE, without being a huge mess of a GUI and a resource hog.
Inspired by these tools I started exploring things like [inf-ruby](https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby) and running terminals withing Emacs (via [ansi-term](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm)  more often than opening tmux windows and panes. There is simply no need.

## Removing tmux

 Using [daemon mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon) in Emacs one can replicate all features (and more) of tmux/screen:

 - sessions can be suspended and resumed
 - universal copy and paste between terminal any type of a buffer
 - window/pane layout management
 - tmux 'windows' can be emulated with packages like [eyebrowse](https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse)

 ## `ssh-agent` issue

 Because I work in a Vagrant VM one of the issues I kept running into was that after ssh'ing back to the tmux session, all currently active shell sessions
 would lose connection to the `ssh-agent`.

 With a simple shell script:

 ```bash
 if pgrep -f emacs ; then
  emacs --daemon

fi

emacsclient -nw

 ```

 and [an extra package](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader/commit/17ed38e4fe5e6b6f2140ebf97e5b798118b652a7) I can now use [magit](https://magit.vc/) without any issues.


## Issues?

Only issue I keep running into is that a long running (week?) Emacs session sometimes becomes corrupted and syntax higlighting stops to work.
I haven't found a fix for this, but given my experience with Emacs so far the fix surely exists :-)
