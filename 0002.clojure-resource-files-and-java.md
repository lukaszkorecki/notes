I'm still pretty new to JVM land, despite of using Clojure in production for a year and some random past episodes of working on Android and JRuby projects.
With that I'm still finding some oddities and unexpected things in how JVM based languages work and manage certain things.

## Expectations

For example - when packaging a Ruby project into a gem, it's pretty safe to assume that if your library ships with a resource file (for example a html template), it can be read like this:

```ruby

class Foobar
  TEMPLATE = File.read(File.expand_path('./tmpl.txt', __FILE__))
end

```

This pretty much guarantees that if `foobar.rb` and `tmpl.txt` are in the same dir, no matter where and how the gem is installed or if we're just running the code via `ruby ./lib/foo/foobar.rb`.

In Java/JVM land things are not so simple.

Above snippet would work, however if we're creating and distributing a library as a `jar` file things are getting complicated.


## Real world

My scenario was this:

- I have a service written 100% in Clojure (let's call it `foo`, obviously)
- I have a library `bar`, also 100% in Clojure
- Library `baz` is 99% Java and 1% is a Clojure wrapper, additionaly `baz` needs static resource files to work (think configuration/db for a NLP model)

`foo` depends on `bar` and `baz`.

As I'm using [bintray](https://bintray.com) to host a private Maven repo, things are pretty simple. With Leiningen all I have to do is add:

```clojure

;; used for publishing as a lib
 :deploy-repositories [["releases"
                         {:url "https://api.bintray.com/maven/repo/maven/bar/;publish=1"
                          :sign-releases false
                          :username :env/bintray_username
                          :password :env/bintray_api_key}]
                        ["snapshots"
                         {:url "https://api.bintray.com/maven/repo/maven/bar/;publish=1"
                          :sign-releases false
                          :username :env/bintray_username
                          :password :env/bintray_api_key}]]

```

to `project.clj` and run `lein deploy`. This will compile everything, create a maven package and upload it to Bintray.

Then in `foo`'s `project.clj`:

```clojure
 :repositories [["bintray"
                 {:url "https://repo.bintray.com/maven"
                  :snapshots true
                  :username :env/bintray_username
                  :password :env/bintray_api_key}]]
```

will make private libs available as dependencies.

### So far so good

As one would expect `baz` the Java/Clojure lib proved to be a bit problematic:

- extra resource file was read at runtime, and the code assumed it's available under `resources/db.txt`
- when deployed as a jar (even locally, using `lein install`) the file would get included
- **however** using `baz` as a dependency in `foo` wouldn't work as the file's path would no longer be a file system path, but instead it would get turned into a [resource](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/lang/resources.html).

My first approach was to convert all the code from simply reading files from paths to using resources:

```java
// before

class SomeStuff {
  private final db;

  public void SomeStuff(String pathToDB) {
    db = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(pathToDB));
  }
}

// after

// in tests
InputStream in = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(pathToDB);

class SomeStuff {
  private final db;

  public SomeStuff(InputStream db)
    db = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(db));
  }

}


```

then in Clojure:

```clojure

;; before
(SomeStuff. "resources/db.txt")

;; after

(require '[clojure.java.io :as io]

(SomeStuff. (-> "db.txt"
                io/resource
                io/file
                io/input-stream))

```

I've run the test and pushed to our CI server. Everything works.
Tested the code in REPL, all fine.

# Neat

After `lein install` I've happily used `baz` code in `foo` and run the tests and...


```

billion lines of stacktraces

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not a file: jar:file:/home/vagrant/.m2/repository/baz/baz/1.0.7-SNAPSHOT/baz-1.0.7-SNAPSHOT.jar!/db.txt

```


Since `jar` files are just zips, I've peeked inside and `db.txt` was there. Both Clojure and JUnit tests were passing fine in `baz` so... What. The. Hell?


I've started checking out how other people do this since Googling didn't help much. Very quickly I realized my mistake. You see `java.io.InputStream` knows how to deal with many things - not only Files but also... Resources.


So:

```clojure

;; before

(require '[clojure.java.io :as io]

(SomeStuff. (-> "db.txt"
                io/resource
                io/file
                io/input-stream))

;; after


(SomeStuff. (-> "db.txt"
                io/resource
                io/input-stream))

```
Seemed like a bit of a random change but:

- tests in `baz` worked just fine
- after installing to a local Maven repository `foo` pulled `baz` just fine
- tests in `foo` worked as expected


## Summary

TIL how to:

- ship a mixed Clojure/Java project as a lib
- that lib has some resources (that are not code)
- and how to use all that in *another* Clojure project
