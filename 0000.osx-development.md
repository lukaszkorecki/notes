# Using OS X for development considered harmful

I have been using virtual machines for all my programming work for nearly 5 years now. It’s very unlikely that I will ever set up any development environment on a real machine ever again.

## When Ruby 1.9 was the next big thing

In order to set myself up when I started working at one job I had to:

- Compile the server core by hand (it was written in C++ and required specific version of boost)
- Install a handful for python packages (that was around when `easy_install` was the first choice for dependency management), most of which wouldn’t work on OSX
- Get the rest of the stack running (regular Ruby 1.8.7 + Passenger + Rails 2)

Doesn’t sound that bad — it took a day or two to get fully set up. If you were lucky.

I was lucky and I could take the easy way out and skip to point 3 and use staging server as the rest of my stack. Of course life is not all roses and it all was depending on the quality of the internet connection. Which of course was terrible.

SSH tunnels while a great idea, don’t work very well on bad connections.

## Going cyber virtual internet

Around that time Vagrant wasn’t even at v1 but it looked like the next best thing.

I got myself a Vagrant powered machine, wrote some shell scripts and… I never looked back.

Gradually I moved all my development stack to the VM, learned to be better at using tmux (by that time I was a full time Vim user anyway so I didn’t miss any GUI).

That was in 2011. Since then whenever I started at new job I had two choices:

- Spend 2 days getting my Mac set up
- Spend half a day, automate as much possible and benefit everyone whoever joins after me — even if they will not use the VM like I do, at least all other dependencies (DBs, queue systems etc) are all in place
- VM setup was as close as possible to production so there were additional debugging benefits

Of course switching 100% to a VM based environment is not without problems.

### No GUI

if you’re used to text editors like Sublime Text and you absolutely have to see all your files in Finder (or whatever), you’re going to have a hard time.

### It’s not a real machine!

VirtualBox (and others) have their quirks and you’ll never get that raw, bare metal speed — that said, your dev machine shouldn’t be used for benchmarking either.

### One machine to rule them all

One mistake I made was to create one Vagrant machine for everything — host the DB, run code, tests. This quickly bit my ass when my whole team started using VMs.

I decided to split my setup into multiple VMs — one for work, other for application dependencies (Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch etc).

This is when I hit my biggest obstacle — work became unbearable. Sure, everything is automated and all that but I can barely use Firefox. My Macbook Air can barely keep up and it doesn’t look like I will be able to upgrade my machine anytime soon.

## The cloud ☁

>️ How can I upgrade this machine by not spending too much money?

I had this idea for a while and I kinda did it before (see beginning of this post).

I’ve looked at AWS free tier machines and realized that t2.medium instance offers quite nice balance between what I need and the price. If it’s too slow — I can get couple of free tier instances and farm out other dependencies while keeping faster machine to myself.

Of course all that is not set up by hand — I already had a way of provisioning virtual machines, I just had to move the machines off my computer into the cloud ⛅️

## 1979

This is the promise of ChromeBooks, but taken to extreme. All my machines can burn down and if I’m in a real pinch all I need is something connected to the internet, SSH client and a terminal emulator.

Don’t get me wrong — I still keep a trusty VM around for offline work, but in the times of tethering, super cheap EU roaming (thanks O2) and mosh it doesn’t really feel that much different than the workflow I’ve been using for last 5 years.

I took it as far as I can, I have 3 VMs which I use everyday:

- Comms — permanent tmux session with Weechat (connected to 3 Slack and 1 Freenode account) and Mutt
- Work — this is were I work
- Storage — hosts databases and other services (Elasticsearch, Redis etc)

It pays off to write shell scripts and be comfortable with the terminal.

#### Update

I'm back on Vagrant - after 9 months of working exclusively in the cloud I got myself a Macbook Pro
with enough CPU and RAM to replicate my remote setup locally.

Main reason was that I started traveling more often and more often than not I'd be using crappy
internet connections.

That said - because of all that experience, migrating back was as easy as it could get. For the most
part it was updating hostnames in my `~/.ssh/config`.
