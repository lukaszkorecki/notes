# Debugging if statsd-like monitoring

While working on [statsd reporter lib for Chicken Scheme](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/statsd-chicken)
I had to check if stats are actually being sent.
Setting up statsd and graphite is quite... involved, luckily there's couple
projects based on Docker which give a full Grafana + Graphite + Statsd setup.

That works fine, but this is still too much if I just want to see if the metrics
are being sent at all and if so - in what format.

While researching completely unrelated thing (state of web frameworks in Clojure),
I stumbled upon [monitoring example in Pedestal project](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/helloworld-metrics#statsd-metrics-reporting) which has a really nfity snippet:

```shell
nc -kul 8125
```

`netcat` is a swiss army knife of networking and the snippet above will create
a "server" which will listen for UDP packets on port 8125. Easy

This reminded me that in the past I used the following:

```shell

echo "some.random.stat:$RANDOM|g" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 8125
```

to test collectd's [statsd plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Statsd)
